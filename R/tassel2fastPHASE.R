#' Convert between TASSEL hapmap file and a fastPHASE input

#' @description
#' Converts from a TASSEL hapmap file, which typically has diploid encoding of
#' genotypes (i.e. AA or CC or AC) to an input file for fastPHASE, which is formatted
#' line-by-line and contains information that is more haplotype-based.
